This information has to be provided explicitly to the algorithm as an extra feature, as it does not have common knowledge. This important Data Science process is called \"Feature Engineering\", and often makes the difference between a good and a bad model.\n",

    "- The title of each person might correlate with their survival probabillity. (e.g. Mr. most unlikely, Miss more likely, Countess most likely,...)\n",
    "- The size of a family might matter as these people are likely to help each other. This is however currently split up between two columns `SibSp` and `Parch`, we could merge them to a `FamilySize` column by adding them to each other.\n",
    "- In earlier times, wealthier people often had longer names, so this could be another feature.\n",
    "- The change from being a child to being an adult, as people are more likely to give the spot in a rescue boat to a child (combination of `Title`, `Age`, and `Sex`)\n",
    "- The number of relatives on the boat, as those are people which are likely to help each other.\n",
    "- An `ID` for each family on the boat. If one member survives, the are more likely to be in the same rescue boat.\n",
